- **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**: Gain insights into setting up automated development pipelines, boosting efficiency and minimizing errors during the deployment phase.

## Tech Stack
- **Front-end**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React (for responsive and dynamic user interfaces)
- **Back-end**: Django (Python framework for rapid development and clean design)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (relational database for structured data storage)
- **API**: GraphQL (for flexible and efficient data querying), Django REST Framework (for RESTful APIs)
- **Security**: JWT, OAuth (for secure authentication and authorization)
- **DevOps**: Docker (for containerization), GitHub Actions (for CI/CD pipelines), Celery (for asynchronous tasks), Redis (for caching)
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub (for collaborative development)
