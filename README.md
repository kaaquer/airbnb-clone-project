  - Protects sensitive operations like updating bookings or processing payments.

- **Rate Limiting**:
  - Apply rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks on API endpoints.
  - Maintains system availability and performance under high traffic.

- **Data Encryption**:
  - Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., payment details) in transit and at rest using HTTPS and secure storage practices.
  - Prevents unauthorized access to critical information.

**Importance of Security**:
- **Protecting User Data**: Secure authentication and encryption prevent data breaches, safeguarding personal information like emails and passwords.
- **Securing Payments**: Robust authorization and encryption ensure payment transactions are safe, building user trust in the platform.
- **Preventing Abuse**: Rate limiting and access controls protect the system from malicious activities, ensuring consistent performance for all users.
